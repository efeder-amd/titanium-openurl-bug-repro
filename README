# Description of the Issue
I am using Titanium SDK 10.1.1.GA.
After I upgraded to iOS 15.4.x from 15.3.x, `Ti.Platform.openURL` stopped working for telephone numbers with a `*` in them.
I am using this to allow users of my app to place calls hiding their number using `*67` to prefix the called number.

It still works for numbers without a `*`, opening a dialog box confirming the choice to dial the number. But when the number is prefixed with `*67` it no longer works.
I am attaching a sample app reproducing the issue. If you run on 15.3.x, both buttons work to place the call, but if you run on 15.4.x it no longer works.

When tracking down the code path for `openURL` I found that it [simply proxies](https://github.com/tidev/titanium_mobile/blob/b3256959bf84a6fb2e3e86554cdc0867f0d533c3/iphone/Classes/PlatformModule.m#L335) the underlying native openURL function, so this must have been an underlying Apple iOS change that broke it. 
I was researching the underlying Apple functions, and I found a couple of possibilities. I'm not really sure which one Titanium is using.

1) A method of [UIApplication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1648685-openurl/)
2) A method of [UIApplicationDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623112-application?language=objc)
3) I also saw this [open](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1648685-open) method - I'm not sure what the pro's/con's would be of using this over the openURL method.

I also saw that in the [Apple URL scheme Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/PhoneLinks/PhoneLinks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007899-CH6-SW1) it specifically says that `*` and `#` characters are not supported, but this may be escaped using [stringByAddingPercentageEscapesUsingEncoding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1415058-addingpercentescapes). That function is not available in titanium, but I did try encoding the `*` as `%2A` which did not work.

My issue/question is -- is there any functionality that could be added to the titanium iOS library or a way I can use hyperloop to be able to use telephone numbers prefixed with `*67`?

# How to Reproduce
Using SDK 10.1.1.GA, build the app on an iOS device running v15.4.1.
You will need a provisioning profile associated with the app id.

`ti build -p ios -T device`
